## Dependency Pinning

This project uses `polkadot-sdk` from git tag `polkadot-stable2512-3`.

- Keep FRAME/Substrate dependencies on the same git source/tag across runtime
  crates.
- Avoid mixing crates.io and git-sourced `polkadot-sdk` dependencies in one
  workspace.

The main project documentation remains in [`../README.md`](../README.md).
